with the predeployed and the ipfs hosted UI "Gnosis MultisigWallet" system, you can create any number of multisig contracts on the skale chain


The MS controlled route is rather

1. assemble the payload for the IMA call using multisig-cli
2. go to L2 IPFS MS gui
3. enter payload
4. sign (even if it's 1/1 MS for testing)
